# Data Visualization on Drivers of Central American Migration
This project uses 2010-2017 survey data of Honduran, Guatemalan, and El Salvadorean residents from the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP),
as well as survey data collected by Encuesta Sobre Migracion en la Frontera Sur de Mexico (EMIF-SUR) of Central American migrants deported by US and 
Mexican migration forces, to better understand the new drivers of migration. This data is then overlaid with US foreign aid data to these nations. 
## Purpose
This project attempts to answer several critical questions regarding the current Central American migration 'crisis':
- What role do perceptions of insecurity and economic opportunity play in motivating Central American migrants to journey northward, and how have those perceptions changed over time?
- Has US aid shifted to address challenges related to violence and opportunity in the region?
- What challenges do migrants face in their journey through Mexico, and where along the way do they face greatest difficulty?
- Are there material differences between migrants deported from the US and those deported from Mexico?
- And much more!
